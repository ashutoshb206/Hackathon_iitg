# Hackathon - IITG
A Jupyter Notebook-based data analysis and modeling project created for the IITG hackathon. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model from provided training data.

🧩 Project Overview
Objective: To analyze a dataset (hacktrain.csv), train a machine learning model, and generate predictions on a test set (hacktest.csv).

Dataset Files:

hacktrain.csv: Training data with features and target variable.

hacktest.csv: Unlabeled data for prediction.

submission_hackathon.csv: Sample submission format.

Solution: All steps—from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and final prediction—are contained in the single Hackathon_iitg.ipynb notebook.

📚 Technologies Used
Language & Environment: Python via Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy: Data handling and manipulation

scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation

(Add any others you used, e.g., matplotlib, seaborn)

💾 Setup & Usage
Clone the repo

```bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ashutoshb206/Hackathon_iitg.git
cd Hackathon_iitg
Install dependencies
```

```bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, you can install the key libraries individually: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter.)
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Hackathon_iitg.ipynb
Open and run each cell from top to bottom.
```
Generate predictions

The notebook processes hacktest.csv, trains a model on hacktrain.csv, and exports predictions into submission_hackathon.csv.

Verify and submit these results for evaluation.

🛠️ Notebook Structure
Data Loading – Import CSV files, basic data checks

Preprocessing – Handle missing values, categorical encoding, scaling, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Data structure, distributions, correlations

Model Selection – Train-test split, model training

Evaluation – Metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE), validation checks

Final Predictions – Generate submission-ready results

✅ Features
Clean and modular workflow in Jupyter Notebook

Reproducible data preprocessing and modeling pipeline

Easy-to-modify code sections for experimenting with different algorithms or parameters
